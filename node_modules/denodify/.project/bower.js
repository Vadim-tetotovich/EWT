// This file is the source for constructing a `package.json` file.
// JSON is a wonderful interchange format, but due to the fact that the

// it horrid for self documenting examples.
//
// JavaScript allows for comments and inherently allows JSON. This file will
// act as the source for building a `package.json` file that also manages this
// package.
//
// It is the closest I can get to a self-documenting `package.json` file.


//Before executing this file for the first time do:
//npm install fs-extra
//in the sites directory

// The `package.json` file always consists of one top level object, which is
// what we export here in a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) friendly way that
// will allow us to build our `package.json` file. A real `package.json` file
// will not contain the `exports = ` definition, nor any of these comments.

    // is by its nature always optional.

    // our package into an npm registry. If we aren't going to publish the
