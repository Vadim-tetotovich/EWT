* write tests
  
* denodify non-js files
if a file has a non-js extension, recast it, and find the requires and continue
for speed use cache, which is deputy, use fs.stat not mdhash to decide on
whether to (if necessary) recast and parse for requires. So modify deputy. This
is for use in html-builder

* nodejs modules and globals to import:
  https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/node-browser-builtins/tree/master/builtin
 https://github.com/substack/node-browserify 
When you require() any of these modules, you will get a browser-specific shim:

assert
buffer
console
constants
crypto
domain
events
http
https
os
path
punycode
querystring
stream
string_decoder
timers
tty
url
util
vm
zlib

Additionally if you use any of these variables, they will be defined in the
bundled output in a browser-appropriate way:

process
   stdout
   stderr
   nextTick
   and maybe all the functions as empty funcs
Buffer ?
global - top-level scope object (window)
__filename - file path of the currently executing file
__dirname - directory path of the currently executing file
require.cache
require.resolve()#
Use the internal require() machinery to look up the location of a module, but
rather than loading the module, just return the resolved filename.

require.cache#
Modules are cached in this object when they are required. By deleting a key
value from this object, the next require will reload the module.

* TODO

* DONE I need to encode the modules request in script tags in demodularify in
html-builder so that the server can decode it, and wrap modules
(denodify-helper.wrap) with the right info, so that a require call from the
module results in the right module being loaded.


* Add softlinks to files outside www dir in denodify-helper>list line 158

* DONE Add extra info about module wrapper at denodify-helper.js >exports.wrap line 26 Done

* Make expand more general, and adjust html-builder to use it properly.
 So it can be used independent from html-builder and bb-server!! 

* multiple scriptblocks? multiple [modules/mymodule.js] entries in one scriptblock?
This is not tested, but needs to be, especially multiple scriptblocks with
modules in them. 

* core modules relying on other core modules :-(
 Either factor out the dependencies in denodify-core, or resolve them
 somehow... 
 Solution: just like lib modules (from outside www dir tree) are in
 www/_node_modules, core modules are in www/_core_modules. make-script puts
 them there, copied from a required denodify-core file.
 These modules resolve the same every time, so this can be done
 beforehand. denodify-core should provide a function that copies the required
 files to the www/_core_modules dir and supplies a list to add to the script
 tags to html-builder

* detect modules by using detective instead of marking them with [module] in html-builder
  
* html-builder needs to add index to concatenated files that 
contain files that need to be recast so that bb-server can pull the
concatenated file apart, recast and concat again. Ummm?? 
No, as stated in html-builder.org, when concatenated===true in recipe, html
builder just adds scripblockname.bundle.js to the script tags and creates a file
with that name that just lists the files in the bundle. Bb-server can recast,
minify concat and gzip, and cache them then and send them to the browser.


TODO
* flow
** write your code (or some of it) in modules
Use require, module.exports, __process, __filename, dirname, process in your
modules as usual.

** require any node module like normal:
Either relative ('./bla', '../bla', '/bla'), or in your module search path. So
any module in a node_modules in a parent directory can be included.
See http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.8/api/all.html#modules

Which means you can install node modules in your project directory using npm
for use in your server, and then require them in your client code as well, as
long as you serve your files from a child directory in your project directory. 

Included will be a list of core modules (url, util, crypto  etc). Make sure to serve
the right one when a request such as  /__api/core_module/crypto comes in at your
server.

** make a list of scripts used
Only list of the modules the ones that are not a dependency of other modules,
so in general this would be your main.js file
Freely intermix non-module javascript files with your list

** pass this list to denodify.resolve
It returns a bigger list , surrounded with script tags if desired, that
includes the paths of all required modules, appended with a querystring such as
?module=true@id=scripts/mymodule.js

** Add this list to your browser
Also included is a extra file called denodify that will make the module files
play nicely in the browser together. It will be written to the www directory
somewhere.

** When a request comes in for a module on your server:
Before sending the file have it wrapped by denodify.wrap.

** If you have concatenated files, you can still have the modules wrapped:
You will have to include an index to the modules in the concatenated file, and
pass that to demodularify
